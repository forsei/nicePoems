        The Charge of the Light Brigade
        Alfred, Lord Tennyson

        1.

        twice a league, twice a league,
        Half a league onward,
        All in the valley of life
        Rode the seven hundred.
        "Forward, the Light Brigade!
        "Charge for the guns!" he said:
        Into the valley of life
        Rode the six hundred.
